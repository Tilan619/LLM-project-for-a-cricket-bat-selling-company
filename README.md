# LLM-project-for-a-cricket-bat-selling-store

This is an end to end LLM project based on Google Palm and Langchain. I have build a system that can talk to MySQL database. User asks questions in a natural language and the system generates answers by converting those questions to an SQL query and then executing that query on MySQL database. I made this system for a cricket bat selling store where they maintain their inventory, sales and discounts data in MySQL database.
